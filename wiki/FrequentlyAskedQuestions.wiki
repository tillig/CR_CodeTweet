= Q: Why can't I use OpenID with CodePaste.NET? =

Unfortunately, the !CodePaste.NET web service API does not allow OpenID as an authentication method. As such, the only way to programmatically access the service is using the standard username/password authentication.

= Q: Why did I get an error while communicating with Twitter? =

You must be new to Twitter and its reliability problems. Go [http://www.google.com/search?q=fail+whale Google "fail whale."] Twitter's not known for its uptime or stability.

Basically, if you have problems... try again later. Check to ensure that Twitter's actually up, isn't being flaky, and there isn't a problem where you've got something blocked by a firewall. If it's not being blocked, give it a day. If it's still not back, go look in the !DevExpress message log, grab the error information, and [http://code.google.com/p/cr-codetweet/issues/list file an issue]. We'll see if we can't fix you up.
