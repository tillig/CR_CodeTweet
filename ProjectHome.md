Sometimes you have a snippet of code in Visual Studio that you'd like to share over [Twitter](http://twitter.com). You used to have to post the code snippet somewhere (or take a screen shot), then manually tweet the link to that snippet.

**Not anymore!**

CR`_`CodeTweet is a plugin for [DXCore](http://www.devexpress.com/Products/Visual_Studio_Add-in/DXCore/) that adds a context menu and hotkey that allows you to select code in Visual Studio and automatically post it to [CodePaste.NET](http://codepaste.net), then tweet a link to that posted snippet - all without leaving Visual Studio.

Select your code and use a simple context menu...

...fill in your tweet info and your selected snippet hits the interwebs!
